# Weekly Challenge #10

The Weekly Programming Challenge : http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2016/10/1/weekly-programming-challenge-10.html

## Installation

Build solution using Visual Studio to create the binaries.

## Usage

Look for boiaries inside bin/Debug folders. Run server and then client executables.

The query engine converts a number into a binary string, nothing fancy here :)
